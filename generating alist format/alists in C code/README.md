# What is alist file format?
A type of file format that is not readable by human but is readable by computer. It was created by David McKay during constructions of LDPC codes. If we want to share our parity check matrix files, we can just directly give the file in an alist format.


**Parity check matrix is referred as H from now on.

# How to run the codes
**In alist_format.c in main:**
1. To read sparse H and convert it into alist format:       *Uncomment pchk2alist();*
2. To read alist file format and convert it into sparse H:  *Uncomment  alist2pchk();*

# How to view code results
 1. **'1_2_5.alist'** is the results of generating an alist format from the sparse H.
 2. **'PCHK generated by alist'** is the results of reading the alist file and converting into sparse H.
